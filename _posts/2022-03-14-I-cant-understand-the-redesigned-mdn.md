The mozilla somehow decided that the old [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/) website needs a new design. **I REALLY don't like the new design.**

I have learn the web technologies (HTML, CSS and Javascript) since forever from MDN, and MDN is really a place to unwind my confusions. The new design look like it abandons me completely: the new design is cold, "modern", unwelcoming. I am being nostagic here, but the old design don't squeeze navigation bar at a narrow corner, eliminate the search bar altogether, use standard 1:3 grid for `<nav>` and `<main>` instead of something that limits max-width and use a very small width for `<main>` that is only optimized for phones,  use proper bold serif fonts for heading elements instead of "use sans _plus_ ruling everything not bold".

In short: the new design make a step down from a serious documentation to some fancy marketing campaign.
