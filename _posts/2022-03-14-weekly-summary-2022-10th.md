Self taught programmer: starting to learn *Computer Networking* (I plan to complete labs from Fall 2021 Stanford [CS144](https://cs144.github.io/)). Also some other work: trying to further improve my blog theme; setting up [RSShub](https://docs.rsshub.app/en/).

## Teach myself Computer Science
I consider myself a power user of linux, but I haven't undertake any professional training on programming. I am looking forward to working as a programmer, and the fall hiring season is approaching. So this is really the time to get myself prepared for a programming job!

I am interested in fundamental stacks of linux (and probably linux desktop, but there aren't many well paying jobs for it), so extensive knowledge in computer science is very desirable. I presume Computer Science knowledge becomes somewhat less relevant for programmers that mostly do repetitive CRUD jobs, because they need to prioritize on high level tooling that fits their business logic. I won't get interested in such jobs anyway; I am a student from Peking University! I am supposed (and generally expected) to resolve challenging tasks.

I have proficiency in programming C, C++ and to a lesser extent, Python. I also took a mandatory course *Data Structures and Algorithms*, but CS professors at Peking University sucks pretty hard at teaching, and I retain very few bits from this course now. I need to cram in lots of algorithms knowledge, because literally every job interview asks algorithms questions. But first I start to do something I have more interest in, *Computer Networking*.

### CS self-taught reference links
The links are comprehensive (although some recommendations are contentious), but I don't have very much time and energy now: I still have to deal with my mechanics courses. I must pick a handful of important self-taught courses to fulfill for these months.

* [csdiy.wiki](https://csdiy.wiki/) (A self-taught guide by a senior at PKU CS who gets deeply disappointed at CS courses at PKU. I attempt to follow this guide as a primary reference during self-taught)
* [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/) (Traditional, old-school view of 9 subjects in CS.  I think this site is for the power programmers)
* [LearnCPP.com](https://www.learncpp.com/) (mostly language features of ISO C++, with hand-by-hand example and in-depth explanation of mechanism; sometimes also with programming style suggestion)
