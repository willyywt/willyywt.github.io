Self taught programmer: starting to learn *Computer Networking*; Trying to further improve my blog theme; Setting up [RSShub](https://docs.rsshub.app/en/).

## Teach myself Computer Science
I consider myself a power user of linux, but I haven't undertake any professional training on programming. I am looking forward to working as a programmer, and the fall hiring season is approaching. So this is really the time to get myself prepared for a programming job!

I am interested in fundamental stacks of linux (and probably linux desktop, if there are jobs for it), so extensive knowledge in computer science is very desirable. I presume Computer Science knowledge becomes somewhat less relevant for programmers that mostly do repetitive CRUD jobs, because they need to prioritize on high level tooling that fits their business logic. I won't get interested in such jobs anyway; I am a student from Peking University! I am supposed (and generally expected) to resolve challenging tasks.

I have proficiency in programming C, C++ and to a lesser extent, Python. I also took a mandatory course *Data Structures and Algorithms*, but CS professors at Peking University sucks pretty hard at teaching, and I retain very few bits from this course now. I need to cram in lots of algorithms knowledge, because literally every job interview asks algorithms questions. But first I start to do something I have more interest in, *Computer Networking*.
