Some features require javascript to work:
- Site Preferences
- Math (using MathJax)
- Dark theme
- Search

If javascript is disabled, these features will not work properly, but other features are unaffected.

The source code can be viewed in [github.com/willyywt/willyywt.github.io](https://github.com/willyywt/willyywt.github.io). JavaScript is compressed using [jscompress.com](https://jscompress.com/), whose source code is avaliable at [github.com/circlecell/jscompress.com](https://github.com/circlecell/jscompress.com).
