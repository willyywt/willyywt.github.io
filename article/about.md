## About me
I am an undergraduate student at the mechanics department, Peking University. 

Good at math (after all, mechanics is the most mathy thing just after pure mathematics...), Interested in programming with mostly C and sometimes C++. 

A user of Fedora Zhongwen (Chinese) User Group (see telegram channel: [fedorazh](https://t.me/fedorazh))

Pretty bad at sports.

A fan of singer [Zhou Shen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_Shen). Best known for "Big Fish", he has a tender and translucent voice and have crystal clear powers. He is also talented in imitating various voices ranging from little girls to old witches. He is silent and calm for most times just as his songs presents but sometimes becomes funny or bizarre when he finds it intersting to do so.

Also interested in various other singers like utaite singer [Jayn](https://utaite.fandom.com/wiki/Jayn) ("littlejayneycakes" on youtube) ("utaite" probably means "anime and Vocaloid")
